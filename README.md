#### single board computers, by creating and linking blocks of functionality.

Written in Erlang and built on the Nerves project

Current state as of 18-Jun-2016:  
   
   Working to get to the point where the system is in a demo-able state
   
   
   Build status is failing, because Travis CI can't find / execute relx
     Not sure how to resolve that
